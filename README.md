## get your own token files:
go to:

replace the number after the # with the token number you want to project.       
if you want you can modify speed and/or FPS in the settings.     
once you're happy click on the lower right corner of the page,        
a red circle will appear signaling that itâ€™s now recording.     
don't touch anything now. it is recording the token animation. wait for the red circle to dissapear.        
after a full loop a file of token_N.json will be saved to your downloads folder.    
you can now copy that file to the projectKleee02 folder and project it.       
note: some of the settings of the editor will be taken into account like FPS and Animation Speed.
